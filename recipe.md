Preparing and Cooking the Bhaji
1. Heat a large pan, add 2 to 3 tablespoons butter.
2. As soon as the butter melts, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds. Let the cumin seeds crackle and change
their color.
3. Add finely chopped onions, mix with the butter on a low to medium flame until translucent.
4. Add ginger-garlic paste (or 1½ inch ginger and 5 to 6 medium garlic cloves in a mortar & pestle).
5. Mix and sauté until the raw aroma of both ginger and garlic goes away.
6. Add diced green chilies. Mix well.
7. Add finely diced tomatoes. Mix very well.
8. Begin to stew tomatoes on a low to medium flame. The tomatoes will become soft and mushy and
you will see butter releasing from the sides. This takes about 6 to 7 minutes on a low to medium
flame. If the tomatoes start sticking to the pan, then sprinkle in some water and mix well.
9. When the tomatoes have softened, add finely diced green and orange bell peppers. Cook for 2 to 3
minutes. If the mixture starts sticking to the pan, sprinkle in some water. You don’t need to cook the
peppers until very soft... a little crunch is okay!
10. Add turmeric powder and red chili powder and mango powder.
11. Add pav bhaji masala. Mix very well.
12. Add the cooked veggies with all of the stock or water from the pressure cooker in which the veggies
were cooked. Mix very well.
13. Season with salt to taste.
14. With a potato masher, begin to mash the veggies directly in the pan, until you achieve your desired
consistency. For a smoother mixture, mash more. For a chunky pav bhaji, mash less.
15. Keep on stirring occasionally and let the bhaji simmer for 8 to 10 minutes (if the bhaji becomes dry
then add some more water; its consistency should be neither very thick nor thin).
16. Stir often so that the bhaji does not stick to the pan. When the pav bhaji simmers to the desired
consistency, check the taste. Add more lemon, salt, pav bhaji masala, red chili powder or butter if
preferred.
17. When the bhaji is simmering, you can fry the bread so that you serve the warm bread with hot
bhaji. Slice the rolls
